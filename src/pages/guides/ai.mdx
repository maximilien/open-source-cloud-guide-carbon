## What is artificial intelligence?

Give a brief description of what AI is and why developers need to know how to extend their cloud offerings with AI services. In other words, how does AI made cloud offerings better?

## Problems?

Are there any problems devs typicall face when thining about extending their cloud with AI? Any common grievances we can address?

## How is AI related to hybrid cloud in general?

I assume it's b/c teams can choose the cloud that works for their workloads/use cases and then extend their oferings with AI services. So those services need to work well with any cloud. But feel free to expand.

## Solution sketch
Is there a standard architecture for incorporating AI services with a multicloud environment? Are there common tools or concepts inherent to this?

## Key open source projects 
I think these are just filler ones, so feel free to expand. Ones with big, openly governed communities are best.

* PyTorch
* Tensorflow
* ONNX
* Spark
* Keras

## Cloud comparison
this is supposed to show how the leading clouds incorporate open source offerings into their clouds.
